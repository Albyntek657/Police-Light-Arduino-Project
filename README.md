# Police-Light-Arduino-Project

This is my personal project that consist of an arduino with an Ir Remote controller and two led strips. 
Start with the project at this link: https://www.instructables.com/Addressable-Strip-LED-Police-Strobo/
that is the basic project that require a single strip and it do all of patterns automatically.
I add the length of the strips and the number: 2 strips with 60 leds for each and the controll of patterns with an Ir Remote

Possible errors may emerge from the libreries, in particular from IRRemote.hpp
For solve them take a look at the repository: https://github.com/Arduino-IRremote/Arduino-IRremote 
where you can find all the documentation that you need.
